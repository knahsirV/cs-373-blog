# What I did this past week

I mostly spent this week working on the assignments for my classes. The first week was just introductions and looking at syllabi, so this was my first week figuring out how my day-to-day would look. I finished my accounting and MIS work for the week, made significant progress on the Collatz project, and started working on my cloud computing assignment. Since the weather has been so good, I've been working and studying outdoors, which I highly recommend. The fresh air keeps your mind from getting saturated, and you end the day feeling great. Currently, I'm waiting for my pasta water to boil as I write this to make dinner. I make a great creamy basil pesto sauce that my roommates always look forward to. While we eat, we'll continue a new show we've started called Alice in Borderland. It's about a group of friends who get trapped in a world where they have to compete in twisted games. It's incredibly intense, and I'm excited to see how it goes. If you enjoyed Squid Game, I recommend giving this a shot on Netflix.

# Things that were in the way

There wasn't anything in the way of my personal life. With this being a fairly relaxing week, I don't have much to complain about. I did have a couple of technical issues setting up my cloud computing environment since the instructions my professor gave didn't match up with the AWS documentation. I solved it by carefully looking at which parts of the documentation lined up with the professor's instructions. I also had a bit of trouble running some of the Makefile commands for the Collatz project, but I circumvented that by running it in a docker image and if needed, running a couple of the commands manually. I'm a bit stuck on getting the last test to pass for the Collatz project, but I'm sure I'll figure it out soon.

# Plans for next week

I don't have major plans for the next week. I imagine it's going to be fairly similar to this week, with me finishing up Collatz and making progress on any other assignments. One of my friends has a meeting at the Austin Central Library for his internship, and a couple of us decided we'll join him after seeing what the library looks like. I'm excited to see what it's like, and I'm sure it'll be a great place to study. On top of that, it'll be a great chance to explore that part of Austin and find some new places to eat.

# Thoughts on Paper #2: Makefile

Though I've seen makefiles in both CS429 and CS439, I've never actually looked at what they're comprised of. After examining the makefile for the Collatz project, I can see how they can be incredibly useful for automating the process of compiling and running code. One command that I found cool was the CTD-generate command to create random inputs for the acceptance tests. Had I not looked at the makefile, I would have probably generated the 300 random inputs by hand, which would have been a huge pain.

# My experience with unit tests, coverage, and IsPrime

This was the first time I've used a unit test framework to run my tests. I've seen them in the past, but I've always been too lazy to use them. I'm glad I finally did because it made it much easier to run the tests and see what was failing. I also used the coverage tool to see how much of my code was being tested, which I realized is useful to see if you're missing any edge cases. I'm glad that this class is forcing us to go through such a robust process when debugging our code as we had to for the IsPrime exercise. The many steps required did initially seem unnecessarily tedious, but I can see how it's a great way to make sure you're not missing anything, especially when you're working on a large project and the bugs get more and more complex. 

# Happiest part of the week

While working outside, a squirrel came up to me and started eating out of my hand. I didn't want to scare it away, so I couldn't take a picture, and instead, the picture at the top of this post is a stock image of a squirrel to serve as a reminder. It sat there for a while as I worked and eventually went on its way. It was adorable and honestly made my day.

# Pick-of-the-week

For anyone who's working on a web development project, I highly recommend checking out [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). It's a utility-first CSS framework that makes it incredibly easy to style your website. It's also really easy to learn, and you can get started in just a few minutes. I've used it for so many of my projects and it's made styling so much easier. This site is styled using Tailwind! What I like about it is that it gives you a lot of control over how your site looks, but it also gives you a lot of flexibility. You can use the pre-built classes to style your site, or you can customize it to your liking. Using it has also just improved my understanding of CSS in general since I've had to learn how to use it to style my site. I highly recommend checking it out if you're looking for a CSS framework to use for your next project.
