# What I did this past week

This week was a fairly normal week. I worked a bit on making the IDB project look better, and I also started and finished my Cloud Computing project. I also had an Accounting exam on Thursday, which I thankfully ended up doing pretty well on. My main goal for the IDK project for this week was to clean up our site and make it look much prettier than it was in Phase 1.

# Things that were in the way

I can't think of anything, particularly that was in the way this week. I did have a little trouble with sleep this week so it made getting to class on time to take the quizzes a bit difficult, but I luckily was able to do so.

# Plans for next week

I intend to finish making our IDB project more aesthetically pleasing and add some more features based on the stories we and our client group have made for us. I also have an MIS exam tomorrow, which should not be too difficult, though it seems that it will be very time-consuming. Next weekend is also the weekend before my birthday, so I'm excited to spend it with my friends.

# Thoughts on Paper #7: Liskov Substitution Principle

Learning about the Liskov Substitution Principle was interesting as it built upon the previous topic of the Open-Closed principle, but took it a step further to lay a framework for the correct means to extend a class and how to allow the source to remain closed to editing from the beginning. The weekly papers have been very helpful in expanding my understanding of object-oriented design and how to write more robust reusable code.

# My experience with iterators, comprehensions, and generators

It was good getting a refresher on the different types of iterators and comprehensions that Python has to offer. I had forgotten about the different types of comprehensions other than lists, and it was good to see how they can be used to make code more concise and readable. I also enjoyed learning about generators and how they can be used to create iterators. I had never used them before, but I can see how they can be useful in certain situations.

# Happiest part of the week

I discovered that you can ask Chick-Fil-A for an unlimited number of sauce packets, so instead of buying containers of Chick-Fil-A sauce, I'm just going to ask for a bunch of packets every time I go. I feel like this is a well-known thing but I was just surprised when I asked for 15 packets and they gave them to me without question, free of charge.

# Pick-of-the-week

Be careful with how granular you make your components in React. By that, I mean that unless a piece of UI is going to be reused in multiple places, it is probably better to just make it a part of the component that it is being used in. Otherwise, you will end up with a lot of components that are only used once, which can make your codebase a bit more difficult to navigate. This can especially be a problem if you are working on a large project with a lot of people, as it can be difficult to keep track of all of the different components that are being used.
