title: Introduction and getting to know me
description: This is a quick intro to me and my background, including why I'm doing this class and what I expect to get out of it. It also provides a brief overview of my experience with web development and programming in general, my thoughts on the first lecture, and my pick-of-the-week.

# Background on me

<p>Hey everyone! My name is Vrishank Viswanath. I grew up in Irving, TX and attended Coppell High School. In that time, my favorite extracurricular activity was a club called Business Professionals of America (BPA), where you competed in various business-related events, though some of them were also CS related, in teams as well as individually. My friends and I joined the club together, making the competitions even more fun.</p>

<p>I came to UT because of how great its CS program is, and because it struck a solid balance of being far enough from home to feel independent, while also being close enough to get a helping hand from my family if I were to need it. I wanted to specifically major in CS because it would enable me to help bring mine and others’ ideas to life in a meaningful way.</p>

# My development experience and thoughts on this class

<p>I specifically was interested in taking this class because I wanted a more formal introduction to the software engineering life cycle. Though I have experience developing applications, I feel like I just hack together a solution in the easiest way I can as opposed to in a way that would make the application robust and more resistant to bugs. Going out of this class, I expect to have a better understanding of how to develop software in a manner that reflects a stronger application developed and used.</p>

<p>I feel I have enough knowledge of Javascript, SQL, and general web programming to create a full-stack application on my own, though it may not necessarily be the most performant, scalable, or secure solution possible. My experience with Python is similar, in that I have enough knowledge of the syntax and semantics to solve “Leetcode-style” programming exercises, and I have dipped into a few of its major libraries like Pandas, numpy, and Flask, but I don’t have a thorough understanding of the language’s nuances to make the fastest possible solution.</p>

<p>I enjoyed the first lectures, and they have made me excited for class going forward. Though I personally am pretty timid to speak up in class, I think the cold calling is overall a positive thing. It will help me get out of my comfort zone, and will also keep us from being absolutely mute the entire time, making the class a little more engaging. As for the specifications grading, I like that we have an exact idea of how our performance correlates with our grade, while also forcing us to maintain a similar standard of work across the different assignments to get the grade we want.</p>

# Highlights of the week

<p>Overall, something that made me happy this week was just getting back to UT and easing into the semester. Syllabus week is generally very relaxed and it's nice to have a buffer before being bombarded with work after a month of not being in this setting at all. </p>

<p>My pick-of-the-week is directed towards people who are interested in web programming. If you already have experience with frameworks like React, I definitely recommend trying out a relatively new JS framework called Svelte. The developer experience is great, and things like state-management are much easier and intuitive to add.</p>
