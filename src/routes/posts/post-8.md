# What I did this past week

This was a pretty busy week. For the IDB project, I finished making most of the frontend aesthetic changes that I wanted to make, and I also am almost done having it fetch data from our API for the models. We're working on finishing up testing, after which we'll be done with this phase. I also had to study for my lab midterm in geology and I needed to not only finish my assignment for cloud computing but also needed to catch up on the lecture content before my exam tomorrow.

# Things that were in the way

I didn't have too much, particularly in my way. I was just on a bit of a time crunch to make sure I allotted enough time to study for my exams and finish up my assignments. Thankfully, I feel like I was able to manage my time well enough to get everything done.

# Plans for next week

I need to finish up the IDB project; I'm expecting to be finished with my part by tomorrow. As I said before, my cloud computing exam is tomorrow, and I'm hoping I do well on that. After that, I think my week is free, so I'm hoping to get a chance to relax a bit and maybe do some more work on a personal project. I also may take the opportunity to play around with some of the concepts that we've been learning in class so that I can get a better understanding of them, and have a better idea of how to use them in the future.

# Thoughts on Paper #8: Interface Segregation Principle

Learning about the Interface Segregation Principle was an interesting addition to the SOLID design pattern. As a programmer, encountering an interface that's too large and unwieldy can pose difficulties for the classes conforming to its implementation. Not only does it create potential code bloat, but also impedes the comprehensibility of system architecture as a whole. To mitigate such problems from arising frequently, ISP advocates for designing software systems with modularity in mind - where each module is flexible enough by being able to cater to specific responsibilities via interfaces uniquely tailored towards them â€“ making your work more impactful through clearer understanding and easier maintenance down the line.

# My experience with yield, closures, and Cache

This week's information was completely new to me and I found it cool. I had no idea that you could effectively save the internal state of a function by using yield. I also thought it was cool how you can essentially reassign what I function does by using closures. Since this was completely new to me my partner and I had a little trouble when working on the Cache exercise initially, but we were able to figure it out.

# Happiest part of the week

I thought that I had bombed my lab midterm for geology, but I ended up getting a 94 on it. In honor of that, the picture above is a picture of pyrite, which is also known as fool's gold.

# Pick-of-the-week

When building out the frontend I recommend styling the mobile interface first, as most of the time, the layout for a mobile interface is simpler and easier to work with. Once you have the mobile interface styled, you can then work on the more complex layouts of the desktop interface.
