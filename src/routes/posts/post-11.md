# What I did this past week

This was a fairly busy week. I finished up phase 3 of my IDB project, adding filtering, sorting, and searching for each of the models, as well as searching for all models at once. I also had to study for my geology test that happened on Thursday, which I ultimately did well on. Along with that I finished my cloud computing assignment that was due today, leaving we the weekened to relax and spend time iwht my friends.

# Things that were in the way

Nothing was really in the way for me this week. I did have a little trouble figuring out how to get all the data from all models at once, as initially had stored all of the instances in a single list. However, since the fetching of the api data is all done by each method in an asychronous manner, I had to store each of the instances in a separate list per model.

# Plans for next week

I don't have any particular plans for the next week. I will get started on Phase 4 of the IDB project, and I also need to look out for my course registration time slot.

# Thoughts on Paper #11. More on getters and setters

I liked how this paper builds off of the last week's paper, encouraging alternative, more maintainable approaches to using getters and setters. The idea of delegation is introduced as a way to ask an object to perform tasks instead of requesting data, ultimately leading to a more object-oriented and problem domain-focused design.

# My experience with theta join, natural join, and SQL

I can see how useful theta join is useful for joining tables that have a relationship that is not one-to-one. I can also see how natural join is useful for joining tables that have the same column names, but I can also see how it can be dangerous if the tables have columns with the same name but different data types. I've used sql before, but it's been a while, so I'm looking forward to learning it in a more formal setting.

# Happiest part of the week

The happiest part of my week was getting a milkshake from the Yard, which I haven't had in a very long time. They're incredibly fattening, but they're some of the best milkshakes I've ever had. I recommend spliting them with another person, as they're quite large.

# Pick-of-the-week

 If you're using React and want to make some complex animations on your website, I recommend checking out Framer Motion. It's a library that makes it easy to create animations and transitions for your React components. It's also very easy to use, and it's very well documented. I've used it in the past, and I've found it to be very useful.
