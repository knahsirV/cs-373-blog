# How well do you think the course conveyed its takeaways?

I feel that they were conveyed very well. The course took the time to explain each of the takeaways and then reinforced them through the projects and quizzes. I feel that I have a much better understanding of how to write good code, and I feel that I will be able to apply these takeaways to my future projects.

# Were there any other particular takeaways for you?

I can't think of any other takeaways that I learned from this course. I feel that the takeaways that were listed above were the most important ones, and I feel that I have a good understanding of them.

# How did you feel about cold calling?

Though I was initially nervous about cold calling, I think it was a great way to keep everyone engaged in the class. I feel that it helped me to learn the material better, and I feel that it helped me to understand the material.

# How did you feel about specifications grading?

I liked how the specifications grading allowed me to focus on my learning, while still having a good understanding of how I needed to perform to achieve my desired grade. I feel that it was a good way to balance learning and performance.

# How did you feel about help sessions and office hours?

I didn't use the help sessions or office hours, but the couple of times that I did go to them, I found them to be very helpful. I feel that the TAs were very knowledgeable, and I feel that they were able to answer my questions.

# How did you feel about the support from the TAs?

As I mentioned above, I feel that the TAs were very knowledgeable, and I feel that they were able to answer my questions. I feel that they were very helpful, and I feel that they were able to help me when I needed it.

# You should have read five papers that describe SOLID design: Single Responsibility, Open-Closed Principle, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion. What insights have they given you?

The papers gave me a better understanding of the principles of SOLID design. I feel that I am much clearer about how to write good code, and I feel that I will be able to apply these principles to my future projects.

# You should have read two papers that advised minimizing getters and setters. What insights have they given you?

One sentence in the papers that stood out to me was: "Don't ask for the information you need to do the work; ask the object that has the information to do the work for you". This can lead to cleaner, more maintainable code that is easier to reason about and less prone to errors. I think this is a good way to think about getter and setter methods, and I will try to keep this in mind when writing code in the future.

# What required tool did you not know and now find very useful?

I did not have a lot of experience with unit testing libraries like the one in Python or Jest, but I found them to be very useful. I feel that they are a good way to test your code, and I feel that they are a good way to make sure that your code is working as expected.

# What's the most helpful Web dev tool your group used that was not required?

My favorite tool that I cannot recommend enough is Tailwind CSS. I feel that it is a great way to quickly build a website, and it makes it incredibly easy to build a website that looks good.

# How did you feel about your group having to self-teach many technologies?

I didn't have any issues with this. Having self-taught myself React before, this was more of getting back into the swing of things. I feel that I was able to learn the technologies that I needed to learn, and I feel that I was able to apply them to my project.

# In the end, how much did you learn relative to other UT CS classes?

I would say I learned about the same amount as I did in other UT CS classes. That said, I feel that the things I learned in this class will be more directly applicable to my future classes, future projects, and future careers.
