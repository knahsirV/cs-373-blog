# What I did this past week

I spent a lot of this week finishing up phase 1 of the IDB project, as well as studying for my geology exam. I'm glad that we were able to meet the deadline as a group and lay the groundwork for the next phase of the project. All of us seem to be on the same page about what we want to do next, and I'm excited to see how it all comes together. I'm also glad that I was able to get a good grade on my geology exam, as I was worried about it for a while.

# Things that were in the way

I had a tiny bit of trouble with getting React Router to work with our project, but was able to figure it out quickly with the help of the documentation and seeing if others online had the same issue. Another issue was communicating the proper times to meet with the group. This wasn't because of our schedules but rather due to Teams not sending notifications properly. I hope this doesn't prove to be an issue in the future.

# Plans for next week

I plan to continue working on the IDB project, to improve the UI and add more features. I also need to study for my accounting exam on Thursday. It would also be beneficial to start working on my Cloud Computing project, as it is due in a week and a half.

# Thoughts on Paper #6: Open-Closed Principle

I found it interesting how encapsulation and abstraction allow these two seemingly opposing concepts of being open for extension and closed for modification to work in tandem with one another. We see this most easily with packages and libraries that we import during development to avoid recreating the wheel. The source code used to build these packages and libraries remains hidden while we are still able to use objects and methods from them and extend their usability for our purposes by creating methods that utilize the provided functions and objects.

# My experience with operators, iteration, and the ethics presentation

I had a good experience with operators and iteration overall. I thought it was especially cool how varied the operation += is depending on the type of variable it is used on. I also thought the ethics presentation was very interesting and informative. I don't about the ethics of software development, but it was interesting to see how it can be applied to the real world.

# Happiest part of the week

I think the happiest part of this week was on Thursday when got home after my geology exam and immediately took a 4-hour nap. I have not been having the best sleep lately, so it was nice to just crash and wake up in the evening with that feeling of zen but not be so energized that I can't sleep the next night. For this week's picture, enjoy a photo of me napping that my roommate took.

# Pick-of-the-week

If you want to improve how your web app looks in the future and make it more polished, I recommend first creating a mockup in Figma to get an idea of what you want to do. I've used it for a few projects and it's been very helpful. It's also free to use, so there's no reason not to try it out.
