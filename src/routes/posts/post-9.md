# What I did this past week

Not much happened this week. We finished up Phase 2 of the IDB project, the part of which that was remaining for this week was just finishing up the tests and the technical report. I also had a cloud computing exam on Monday, which I think went pretty well. The rest of the week was fairly relaxed as I finished up my other assignments. On Friday I went home for Spring Break, and on Saturday I went to a family friend's engagement party.

# Things that were in the way

I didn't have too much, particularly in my way. Overall, with this being a fairly relaxed week, I didn't have too much to worry about. I did have a few things that I needed to get done, but I was able to get them done without too much trouble.

# Plans for next week

Though it's Spring break, I think I will use this opportunity to start looking ahead to the next phase of the IDB project. I think it would be a good idea to start thinking about what I want to do for the next phase, and start working on it. I also plan to do the same for my Cloud computing assignment.

# Thoughts on Paper #9: The Dependency Inversion Principle

Learning about the Dependency Inversion Principle was an interesting addition to the SOLID design pattern. It seems that by following this principle, the code becomes more modular and easier to maintain, as changes in a part of a system are locally isolated. Additionally, it promotes a more flexible architecture, as components can be easily replaced or modified without disrupting the entire system.

# My experience with parameter passing and relational algebra

After learning about parameter passing, I feel like I all of a sudden have been opened up to a whole new part of how Python methods work. For example, I used to always wonder how the print() function could effectively take in any number of arguments, and now I know that it is because of list packing in the method declaration. The relational algebra exercise ended up being more challenging than I expected. I had no issue when we had to do it in the form of a function, but I found the class-based approach to be more difficult.

# Happiest part of the week

I think the happiest part of the week was when I got to go home for Spring Break. My sleep schedule was a bit messed up, but I'm hoping I can get it back on track soon.

# Pick-of-the-week

Python somewhat recently added its version of the switch statement, called the match statement. You can read more about it [here](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0622/).
